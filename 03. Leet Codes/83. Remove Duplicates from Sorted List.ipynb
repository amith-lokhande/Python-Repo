    "**In the above solution, a `linked list` is used because the problem statement specifically mentions working with a linked list. However, if the problem allows using a direct list, you can indeed modify the solution to use a regular list (e.g., Python list) instead of a linked list.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a linked list in the solution has certain advantages and considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Linked List:** <br>\n",
    "**`1. Memory Efficiency:`** Linked lists can be more memory-efficient compared to regular lists since they only require memory for the individual nodes and their connections, rather than allocating a contiguous block of memory for the entire list.<br>\n",
    "**`2. Dynamic Size:`** Linked lists can easily accommodate dynamically changing sizes by adding or removing nodes without the need for resizing or copying elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations for Using Regular List:**<br>\n",
    "**`1. Simplicity:`** Working with regular lists can be simpler and more intuitive in many cases, as they offer built-in operations and indexing capabilities.<br>\n",
    "**`2. Random Access:`** Regular lists provide constant-time random access to elements based on their indices, whereas accessing elements in a linked list requires traversing the list linearly, resulting in a higher time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice between using a linked list or a regular list depends on the requirements and constraints of the specific problem, as well as the trade-offs between memory efficiency, simplicity, and performance."
