    "\n",
    "The provided code defines a **`ListNode`** class and a **`Solution`** class with a method **`mergeTwoLists`**. This method merges two linked lists **`l1`** and **`l2`** into a single linked list in sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through the code step by step and trace its execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **`ListNode`** class is defined to represent a node in a linked list. Each node has a value (**`val`**) and a pointer to the next node (**`next`**).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **`Solution`** class is defined with a method **`mergeTwoLists`** that takes two linked lists **`l1`** and **`l2`** as input and returns the merged linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the **`mergeTwoLists`** method:\n",
    "   - A dummy node is created as the head of the merged list, initialized with a value of 0. The **`dummy`** node helps simplify the merging process.\n",
    "   - A variable **`curr`** is initialized to point to the dummy node. This **`curr`** pointer will be used to traverse the merged list and add nodes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. A while loop is started to compare the values of nodes from **`l1`** and **`l2`** and merge them in sorted order. The loop continues as long as both **`l1`** and **`l2`** have remaining nodes.\n",
    "   - If the value of the current node in **`l1`** is less than or equal to the value of the current node in **`l2`**, the **`curr`** node's next pointer is set to the current node in **`l1`**, and **`l1`** moves to its next node.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, if the value of the current node in **`l2`** is smaller, the **`curr`** node's next pointer is set to the current node in **`l2`**, and **`l2`** moves to its next node.\n",
    "   - In both cases, the **`curr`** pointer moves to the next node in the merged list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After the while loop ends, there may be remaining nodes in either **`l1`** or **`l2`**. The code appends these remaining nodes to the merged list by updating the **`curr`** pointer accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, the merged list is returned, starting from the next node of the dummy node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code efficiently merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list."
