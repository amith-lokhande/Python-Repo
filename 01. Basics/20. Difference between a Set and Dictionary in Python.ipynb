    "\n",
    "In Python, both sets and dictionaries are data structures used to store and manipulate collections of elements. However, they have some key differences in terms of their characteristics and intended usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Set:`**\n",
    "- A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It does not allow duplicate values.\n",
    "- The elements in a set are not indexed or ordered, so you cannot access them by their position.\n",
    "- Sets are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify elements after the set is created.\n",
    "- Sets are typically used when you need to store a collection of items without any particular order and want to ensure uniqueness.\n",
    "- Set elements must be hashable, which includes immutable types like numbers, strings, and tuples (as long as the tuple contains only hashable elements)."
