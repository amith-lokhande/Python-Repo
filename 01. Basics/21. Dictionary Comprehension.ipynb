    "Dictionary comprehension is a concise and efficient way to create dictionaries in Python. It allows you to create a new dictionary by specifying a key-value expression and an iterable, which is then iterated over to generate key-value pairs. The resulting dictionary is constructed by evaluating the key-value expression for each item in the iterable.\n",

    "In the example above, `{x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}` is the dictionary comprehension. It iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive), where `x` takes on each value in the range. The key-value expression `x: x**2` generates key-value pairs where the key is the value of `x` and the value is the square of `x`. As a result, the dictionary `squares` is created with the keys as the numbers from 1 to 5 and the corresponding values as their squares.\n",
