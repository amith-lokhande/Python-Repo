    "\n",
    "The difference between a `shallow copy` and a `deep copy` lies in how they create and handle copies of objects or data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ``shallow copy`` creates a new object or data structure but references the same elements as the original. In other words, it creates a new container object, but the elements within the container are still referenced by both the original and the copied object. Modifying the elements in one object will also affect the other. Shallow copies are typically created using methods like slicing (`[:]`), the `copy()` method, or the `list()`/`dict()` constructor.\n",

    "On the other hand, a `deep copy` creates a new object or data structure and recursively copies all the elements, including any nested objects, into the new structure. It ensures that the copied object is completely independent of the original. Modifying the elements in one object will not affect the other. Deep copies are typically created using the `copy.deepcopy()` function.\n",
